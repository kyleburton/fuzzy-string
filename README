Title: A Survey of Fuzzy String Matching Algorithms

Brief: 

Do you like how Google suggests a fix when you mis-spell (I mean typo)
a word?  Did you ever wonder how you could implement a spell checker?

Fuzzy string matching dates back to the 1800s to the US Census
Bureau's mandate of not overcounting the US population.  My personal
exploration into the record linkage aspect of data integration has
touched on several fuzzy string matching algorithms.  Come and hear
about how several of these algorithms work and some of the techniques
I have used in industry settings with large datasets.



TODO:

 - implement the cmdline search over any file listing words
    default this to the dictionary, but also show examples
    using the census names

 - implement a cmdline optimizer (possibly using genetic algorithims)
   which given a training set of yes/no tripples (word-a, word-b, desired-result)
   will tune Brew and / or find a good 'matcher ensemble' function for 
   that data-set
