Title: A Survey of Fuzzy String Matching Algorithms

Brief: 

You like how Google suggests a fix when you mis-spell (I mean typo) a
word...you like how mis-spellings are underlined in red, cleaning things up
before your email is sent.  Fuzzy string matching dates back to the 1800s to
the US Census Bureau's mandate of not overcounting the US population.  My
personal exploration into the record linkage aspect of data integration has
touched on several fuzzy string matching algorithms.  

Come and hear how several of these algorithms work and techniques I have used
them in industry settings with large datasets.
